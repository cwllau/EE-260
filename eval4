Colleen deserves an Excellent because fixed all the previously incorrect kmaps
and truth tables, even though those weren't assigned to her and  helped
significantly with the I2C summary and ASM chart. In addition, Colleen took
several hours of her time to tutor others on how to make and read a 4 by 4
kmap.
Mariah deserves a Very Good because she has tried hard to understand the
concepts and she attempted her assigned tasks.
Kelsey deserves a Very Good because she completed her assigned tasks and made
the VHDL code.
Bri deserves a Very Good because she has tried hard to understand the concepts
and attempted her assigned tasks.
